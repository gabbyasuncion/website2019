As for the tablet layout, I still utilized a grid but took inspiration instead from a newspaper, laying the photos on the outside and placing the text on the inside to increase readability from one menu item to the next. I also placed the map below the menu items now because the new user thought process while using a tablet is to check out what\u2019s available then find a location if it seems interesting. Lastly for the phone design, I created a linear grid that displays all information on its own row so not to crowd the smaller screen and overwhelm the user.

Besides make the company itself seem more legitimate, a responsive site can be customized for any context that a user may be viewing a site. In particular, someone sitting at home on their computer doesn't have the same urgency to make a menu decision as someone heading to the restaurant and looking at the site on their phone. \u200b Lastly, this project was the first I'd coded from scratch using HTML and CSS.

Also, it could be run with the click of a button rather than with a terminal command. \u200b Knowing C now, I'd feel comfortable creating an executable in C that could be executed with a nice GUI that would be optimized to be user friendly and more easily expandable.",o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Conclusion"),"While this wasn't an overly complicated project, it was one of the first CS projects I attempted outside of class assignments. It turned out to be incredibly rewarding when it decreased the duration of such a tedious task to 5 minutes. Having been in a startup environment, I learned that plenty of tasks have to be bootstrapped and cannot necessarily be the most efficient due to limited resources. I also learned situations like these are perfect for both my creative and CS minds. \u200b I enjoyed applying my CS background to an issue outside of school that actually made my life easier later on. I want to continue to apply myself to issues like these and ultimately use my creativity and CS background to come up with solutions to larger issues that affect the world outside of my company."))};var Se=function(){return
